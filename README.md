# bookStore
This is a Go program that uses the Fiber web framework and GORM ORM to handle CRUD operations for a "book" struct. The program defines several functions, such as "CreateBook," "DeleteBook," "GetBooks," "GetBookByID," and "UpdateBook," which handle creating, deleting, reading, and updating books in a Postgres database. The program also uses middleware such as CORS and the dotenv package to handle environment variables.
